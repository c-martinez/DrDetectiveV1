<p>A 77-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy was admitted to this hospital in midspring because of increasing dyspnea, weakness, and diaphoresis.</p>

<p>The patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before admission, when weakness, loss of appetite, fatigue, and diarrhea developed, followed by progressive shortness of breath. On the morning of admission, he awoke with dyspnea, which was worse when he was lying flat; he was unable to catch his breath or get out of bed. He was diaphoretic and felt nauseated and weak, with no chest pain, fever, or cough. The temperature was reportedly 37.8&#176;C. His wife administered acetaminophen and called emergency medical services personnel. On their arrival, the patient's skin was cool and pale, he spoke in sentences of three or four words, and he used accessory respiratory muscles. The blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90 to 91% while he was breathing ambient air. Basilar rales extended a third to half of the way up both lung fields, and the abdomen was distended. Oxygen (5 liters per minute) was administered by a nonrebreather mask, and oxygen saturation increased to 99%. He was taken to another hospital.</p>

<p>On examination, the temperature was 37.2&#176;C, the blood pressure 152/79 mm Hg, the pulse 93 beats per minute (irregularly irregular), the respiratory rate 24 to 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing supplemental oxygen through a nonrebreather mask. There were coarse rales bilaterally, the skin was cool and diaphoretic, and respiratory support with bilevel continuous positive airway pressure was added transiently on arrival, with symptomatic improvement. Electrocardiography revealed atrial fibrillation with intermittent pacing and bifascicular block, with ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, and Q waves in leads V1 and V2, which were reportedly unchanged from 5 months before. A chest radiograph reportedly revealed mild pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly. The serum levels of total bilirubin, creatine kinase MB isoenzymes, and troponin I were normal; other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Nitroglycerin and furosemide were administered intravenously, and acetaminophen was given, as well as the patient's usual doses of digoxin, ezetimibe, levothyroxine, lisinopril, sotalol, and acetylsalicylic acid. The systolic blood pressure decreased to below 100 mm Hg; the intravenous nitroglycerin was stopped, and sublingual and cutaneous nitrate preparations were administered thereafter. Approximately 6 hours after arrival, the patient was transferred by ambulance to this hospital.</p>

<p>The patient had ischemic cardiomyopathy, which was associated with an anteroseptal myocardial infarction 30 years earlier. Two years before admission, echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 23%. He had arrhythmias, including atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia, for which an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) had been placed. Nine months before admission, atrial fibrillation had developed and an ablation procedure was performed; sinus rhythm had predominated since then. The patient also had hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, and he had had a transient ischemic attack, a stroke (suggestive of emboli) while he was receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, a diverticular bleed 2 months before admission, and an appendectomy 3 months before admission. Other medications included fenofibrate and warfarin. He had no known allergies. He was retired, had returned from a prolonged wintertime trip to Florida 3 weeks before admission, and lived with his wife in a wooded suburban community in the Northeast, with no pets. The patient and his wife had traveled extensively through the United States but not internationally. He had stopped smoking 35 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His children were healthy, and he had no contact with sick persons.</p>

<p>On examination, the patient was diaphoretic. The weight was 79.6 kg, the temperature 36.6&#176;C, the blood pressure 90/54 mm Hg, the pulse 85 beats per minute (atrial fibrillation with paced beats), the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing 40% oxygen by face mask. The jugular veins were distended to the angle of the jaw, the lung sounds were diminished and included faint bibasilar rales, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The level of digoxin was therapeutic, and the level of thyrotropin was normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Oxygen supplementation and additional furosemide were administered. The urine output totaled 1975 ml that day, resulting in some improvement in the patient's symptoms; he remained fatigued and dyspneic after minimal activity.</p>

<p>During the night, tachypnea and diaphoresis recurred and were followed by short runs of ventricular tachycardia; magnesium sulfate was administered. Fourteen hours after admission, the patient was diaphoretic, with cool and clammy skin and increasing somnolence. The axillary temperature was 37.2&#176;C, the blood pressure 133/77 mm Hg, the pulse 80 to 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing 40% oxygen by face mask. Breath sounds were coarse, with no rales or wheezing. Serum levels of total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, amylase, and lipase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed clear yellow urine, a pH of 5.5, a specific gravity of 1.015, 1+ ketones, 3+ blood, 2+ protein, and 5 to 10 red cells and 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field. A chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary venous hypertension, atelectasis in the base of the left lung, a small pleural effusion on the left side, and mild cardiomegaly.</p>

<p>Two hours later, 16 hours after admission, a prolonged episode of ventricular tachycardia (190 beats per minute) was recorded on a monitor and converted to sinus rhythm by means of overdrive pacing. The patient was unresponsive; the blood pressure was 69/41 mm Hg and the oxygen saturation 87% while he was breathing 40% oxygen through a nonrebreather mask. The trachea was intubated, and int&#176;ravenous fluids and vasopressors were administered. The patient was transferred to the coronary care unit. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, with a diffusely hypokinetic right ventricle and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 36 mm Hg, and no vegetations.</p>

<p>Vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered. An abdominal radiograph showed no evidence of bowel obstruction or perforation. Specimens of blood and sputum were cultured. That night, the temperature rose to 39.4&#176;C. The next day, the results of a diagnostic test were received.</p>
