<p>A 65-year-old woman was seen in the oral surgery clinic of this hospital because of a nonhealing ulcer of the mandible.</p>

<p>Three years earlier, the patient had been referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic for evaluation and extraction of three teeth: the mandibular right cuspid and first bicuspid and the mandibular left second bicuspid. Dental extractions were performed on an outpatient basis with local anesthesia. The right mandibular teeth were extracted nonsurgically; the mandibular left second bicuspid required a surgical extraction with flap elevation and bone removal. At a postoperative visit 1 week later, the wounds were healing well. During the next 2 1/2 years, the patient had regular routine dental care and reported no problems. Six months before this evaluation, her dentist noticed that the mandibular right second bicuspid was fractured, with an adjacent area of red swollen gingiva at the site of the extraction of the mandibular right first bicuspid. Three months later, a return visit to her dentist revealed a persistent nonhealing ulcer at the right mandibular extraction site and mobility of the mandibular right second bicuspid. The patient was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic for further evaluation.</p>

<p>A diagnosis of multiple myeloma had been made 6 1/2 years earlier, after an 8-year history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Radiographs of the skeleton at that time showed degenerative changes in the lumbar and thoracic spine and knees, with no lytic lesions. Treatment with chemotherapy, including vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone for six cycles, followed by high-dose therapy with busulfan and cyclophosphamide and autologous stem-cell rescue resulted in a complete remission. Intravenous pamidronate (90 mg) administered monthly was begun; 2 years later (4 1/2 years before admission), zoledronic acid replaced the pamidronate. During the 4 years before the current evaluation, multiple myeloma recurred, with a lytic bone lesion of the femoral neck that was treated with radiation therapy. There were also elevations of the serum levels of IgG and paraprotein and a positive bone marrow-biopsy specimen. Treatment with thalidomide and dexamethasone resulted in stabilization of the serum protein levels and a reduction in the number of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Treatment with thalidomide was discontinued after 20 months because of peripheral neuropathy.</p>

<p>There was a history of hypertension, glaucoma, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, osteoarthritis, and an episode of sciatic pain caused by a synovial cyst at the L4-L5 level. The patient, who was black, was married with grown children and worked in education. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. There was a family history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. A brother had prostate cancer, and a grandmother had had uterine cancer. Medications included zoledronic acid (4 mg) given intravenously each month, dexamethasone (40 mg weekly), furosemide, potassium supplements, and conjugated estrogen cream.</p>

<p>On examination of the mouth, there was red, raised soft tissue in the right mandible bicuspid and cuspid region, with mucosal ulceration and exposed bone underlying it. Multiple teeth were missing. A panoramic radiograph revealed an area of sclerotic bone of the right mandible in the region of the extractions, with well-corticated condyles. A diagnostic procedure was performed.</p>
