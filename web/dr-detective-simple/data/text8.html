<p>A 60-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fever, odynophagia, weight loss, and rash.</p>

<p>He had been well until 5 months earlier, when he began to have fatigue and malaise, as well as decreased appetite, and he lost 7.3 kg of weight. Four weeks before admission, a constant ache developed in the upper oropharynx, which was exacerbated by swallowing. It was accompanied by a dry cough and diffuse arthralgias and myalgias. Two weeks before admission, the patient saw his primary care provider, who prescribed amoxicillin. The symptoms persisted, and a pruritic, papular rash developed along the right midaxillary line, spread in a contiguous fashion to include the upper portion of the chest and back, and extended down the left midaxillary line. During the week before admission, painful oral ulcers developed. He lost an additional 2.7 kg of weight. The day before admission, he had a temperature of 38.5&#176;C and came to the emergency department of this hospital.</p>

<p>In the emergency department, the temperature was 38.0&#176;C, the pulse 98 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 96/60 mm Hg; the respirations were 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant showed a prominent pancreatic duct and inflammatory changes in the gallbladder wall that were consistent with mild pancreatitis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen performed after the administration of contrast material showed thickening of the walls of both the large and small intestines; multiple enlarged lymph nodes were present in the retroperitoneum. Chest radiography showed a focal consolidation in the lower lobe of the right lung. The levels of amylase, bilirubin, total carbon dioxide, chloride, creatine kinase, creatinine, glucose, lipase, potassium, sodium, and urea nitrogen were normal. Results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the internal medicine service.</p>

<p>The patient had a history of hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, acne rosacea treated with doxycycline, eczema, and an episode of herpes zoster 20 years earlier. For the previous 5 years, he had noted intermittent pain and swelling in both the small and large joints of his arms and hands. He worked in sales and had been exposed to concrete dust but not to chemicals or radiation. He had a 40-pack-year smoking history and drank two to three alcoholic drinks per week. He had a monogamous relationship with his wife of 38 years. He was an avid hunter and had had many deer-tick bites, the last approximately 1 year before admission. He had no recent exposure to ill persons and had not traveled recently. There were dogs in the home. Medications at the time of admission were hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, pantoprazole, doxycycline, and amoxicillin.</p>

<p>On physical examination, the patient appeared comfortable but fatigued. The temperature was 37.8&#176;C, the pulse 85 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 120/62 mm Hg; the respirations were 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was bilateral conjunctival injection without hemorrhage. The posterior oropharynx was erythematous without petechiae, leukoplakia was present on the dorsal surface of the tongue, and multiple small aphthous ulcers were present on the buccal mucosa. There was bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy; a firm, mobile lymph node, 1 cm in diameter, was present in each axilla. Multiple, small, mobile inguinal lymph nodes were palpable bilaterally. There was erythema on the cheeks, forehead, and nose; an erythematous papular rash was present on the upper portion of the back and chest. No petechiae or purpura were noted. The remainder of the examination was normal.</p>

<p>Hydrochlorothiazide, doxycyline, and amoxicillin were discontinued. On the second hospital day, the temperature was 38.3&#176;C. A dermatologist noted bright erythema on the cheeks, forehead, and nose, with telangiectasias. A rash composed of blanching, erythematous papules on a lacy, erythematous base was present on the torso in a shawl-shaped distribution; there were no petechiae, purpura, bullae, or target lesions. CT scanning of the chest performed after the administration of contrast material revealed consolidation in the lower lobe of the right lung, which was thought to be consistent with pneumonia. There were numerous enlarged mediastinal, prevascular, paratracheal, and hilar lymph nodes that enhanced after the administration of contrast material; the largest was 2 cm in diameter. Small bilateral pleural effusions were also seen. Calcifications were present within the coronary arteries.</p>

<p>Cultures of blood, a rapid plasma reagin test, and tests for antibodies to hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus, Lyme disease, and ehrlichia were negative. Antibody to Babesia microti was present at a titer of 1:256. A throat culture was negative for group A &#946;-hemolytic streptococci. A nasal swab was negative for adenovirus, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus. Cultures of the oral ulcers were negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were both negative. A urine culture was positive for pansusceptible Escherichia coli. Levofloxacin was administered, but fever persisted, with a peak temperature of 38.3&#176;C. The results of serum and urinary protein electrophoresis were normal. The results of additional laboratory tests from the second and third hospital days are shown in Table 1. On the third hospital day, the results of additional laboratory tests were pending, and a diagnostic procedure was performed.</p>
