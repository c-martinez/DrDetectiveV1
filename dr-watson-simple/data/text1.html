<p>A 10-year-old girl was seen in the multidisciplinary Airway, Voice, and Swallowing Center for Children at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, associated with this hospital, because of dyspnea and noisy respirations.</p>

<p>Approximately 3 weeks earlier, a sharp pain in her chest had developed, associated with shortness of breath, while she was walking home from school, a distance of a quarter to a half mile. Thereafter, she had dyspnea with exertion. Her respirations became audible on both inspiration and expiration during exercise but were normal at rest and during sleep.</p>

<p>Two weeks before this evaluation, her pediatrician found that her lungs were clear on auscultation before and after exercise. Peak expiratory flow rate (the maximum flow rate generated during a forced expiratory maneuver) was measured at 75 liters per minute (1.2 liters per second), or 27% of the predicted value of 273.6 liters per minute (4.6 liters per second). After treatment with a short-acting bronchodilator, wheezing was heard on examination, and the peak flow increased to 100 liters per minute (1.7 liters per second, 37% of predicted value). Albuterol and fluticasone by metered-dose inhaler were prescribed, but after 12 days, the symptoms had worsened. On reexamination by her pediatrician, wheezing was audible during inspiration, and peak flow was unchanged at 100 liters per minute. A chest radiograph taken on the same day was reported to reveal no abnormalities. The inhalers were discontinued, and she was referred to the outpatient pediatric pulmonary clinic of this hospital.</p>

<p>Her symptoms were not accompanied by coughing, choking, or difficulty eating. The patient had been born at full-term by cesarean section, with a birth weight of 3.2 kg (7 lb). Growth and developmental milestones were normal. A diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease had been made 2 years before the current evaluation, and it was treated with cimetidine as needed, approximately monthly. She had a history of snoring, without apnea. She had not received influenza or meningococcal vaccines; other immunizations were up to date. Cephalexin had caused urticaria. The patient was a student in elementary school. Her maternal grandmother had had ulcerative colitis and had died of leukemia, her maternal grandfather had bone cancer, maternal aunts had lung cancer and ulcerative colitis, and her paternal grandmother had throat cancer. Her mother and other maternal relatives had gastroesophageal reflux disease and ulcer disease. Her mother had two benign colonic polyps that were diagnosed by colonoscopy, and 5 months earlier she had had a viral illness with dyspnea that resolved; her father had a port-wine stain. Her siblings were healthy.</p>

<p>The patient appeared well. The height was 140.8 cm (50th percentile), the weight 33.3 kg (73 lb, 50th percentile), the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was at rest and breathing ambient air. Tympanic membranes revealed diminished light reflex without effusions; the nares were not flared, and clear rhinorrhea was present. The tonsils were large but did not meet in the midline. The chest was symmetric, without hyperinflation. No stridor was noted on either tidal or accentuated respiration. Mild wheezes, without crackles, were heard bilaterally on tidal and forced breathing. The second heart sound was accentuated, louder to the right of the upper sternum than to the left, without splitting. There was no clubbing or cyanosis of the fingers; the remainder of the examination was normal.</p>

<p>Results of pulmonary-function tests revealed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 111% of predicted value, a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 30%, and an FEV1:FVC ratio of 30. There was a plateau of flow observed on both the inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume loops (Figure 1A).</p>

<p>Two days later, the patient was seen by an otolaryngologist. On examination, there was stridor on inspiration. Transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed mobile vocal folds. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Three days later, a diagnostic procedure was performed.</p>
