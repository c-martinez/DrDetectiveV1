<div id="diagnosis">malignant melanoma, invasive to 0.9 mm, with metastasis to one of two sentinel lymph nodes</div>

<p>A 49-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient surgical clinic of this hospital because of a diagnosis of melanoma.</p>

<p>The patient had noted a flat, pigmented lesion on her left upper arm approximately 1 year earlier. Three months later, it began to itch and became slightly raised. Approximately 3 months before the current evaluation, the lesion began to bleed when she scratched it. She saw a dermatologist at another facility, who performed a punch biopsy. Pathological examination was reported to show an atypical Spitz tumor; reexcision was recommended. The lesion was reexcised; pathological examination disclosed a superficial, spreading malignant melanoma, 0.91 mm in thickness, with a vertical growth phase and dermal mitoses, extending to within 1.5 mm of the nearest margin. Her dermatologist referred her to this hospital for further care.</p>

<p>The patient had no history of skin cancers, and she felt well. An ovarian cystectomy had been performed at the age of 25 years. She had smoked for 10 years but quit at the age of 29 years, and she drank alcohol occasionally. She had siblings with nonmelanoma skin cancers. Her maternal grandmother had breast cancer at 76 years of age, her aunt at 65 years of age, and a cousin at 45 years of age. Her maternal grandfather had throat cancer in his 70s. Her four children were well.</p>

<p>On physical examination, the patient appeared healthy, and the vital signs were normal. There was a 3-mm linear scar on the left upper posterior arm, with no residual pigmented lesion and no satellite nodules. No other suspicious pigmented lesions were identified. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, wide excision of the surgical site to 1 cm and sampling of the sentinel lymph node after injection of technetium-99â€“labeled sulfur colloid were performed. Metastatic melanoma was identified on immunohistochemical staining of one of two sampled sentinel nodes. Two weeks later, the patient returned to the clinic for discussion of further care.</p>
