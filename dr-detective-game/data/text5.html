<p>A 6-day-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distention.</p>

<p>The patient was born at another hospital to a teenaged primigravida by vaginal delivery after a full-term, uncomplicated gestation. The mother had received prenatal care; she had no history of sexually transmitted infections, and prenatal screening tests were negative. Meconium was present at delivery. The patient's birth weight was 4.3 kg (95th percentile), and the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 7 and 9, respectively. Breast-feeding was initiated. The newborn passed two stools on the second day (the first at 30 hours of age). The next day, he reportedly had one loose, green stool. He was discharged home at 50 hours of age. He lived with his mother and her parents. When he was 3 and 4 days of age, he vomited yellow-green emesis on several occasions. He was otherwise well and breast-feeding regularly. At 3 a.m. on the day of admission, he became fussy and did not complete his normal feeding. Between 3 a.m. and 9 a.m., approximately six episodes of vomiting (initially breast milk, followed by mucus) occurred, with increasingly foul-smelling emesis. Diarrhea developed, and urine output decreased. Later that morning, he became less active; abdominal distention developed, and he stopped voiding. He was taken to a clinic affiliated with this hospital. On examination, he appeared tired, with intermittent grunting. The rectal temperature was 38.0&#176;C. The abdomen was distended and tender, with hypoactive bowel sounds; stool was positive for occult blood. He was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital.</p>

<p>On examination, the patient appeared alert and slightly uncomfortable. The temperature was 37.2&#176;C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.9 kg. The abdomen was distended, soft, and tympanic, with decreased bowel sounds. There were small, bilateral noncommunicating hydroceles. The remainder of the examination was normal. A stool specimen showed no occult blood. Urinalysis revealed clear orange urine, with a specific gravity greater than 1.030, pH 6.5, nitrites, 1+ urobilinogen, 3+ bilirubin, 2+ albumin, and trace white cells, blood, glucose, and ketones. Urinalysis also revealed 0 to 2 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, moderate bacteria, and a few squamous and renal tubular cells per high-power field. Ampicillin, gentamicin, and boluses of normal saline were administered. Other test results are shown in Table 1. Radiographs of the abdomen showed dilated loops of bowel in the lower abdomen, which were suggestive of distal bowel obstruction. There was no free air. An upper gastrointestinal series showed severe gastroesophageal reflux without evidence of malrotation. An enema administered with a water-soluble contrast agent revealed free flow of contrast material, with a long segment of narrowing involving the rectum and distal sigmoid colon and proximal distention of the descending colon. No stricture was identified. Rectal examination performed after the enema did not reveal blood or mucus. After the enema, the patient passed multiple nonbloody stools, and the abdominal distention decreased.</p>

<p>Seven hours after arrival in the emergency department, the temperature rose to 38.7&#176;C; acetaminophen was administered. Lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of cerebrospinal fluid is shown in Table 2. Acyclovir was administered. The patient was admitted to the pediatric service. Shortly after admission, the temperature rose to 39.1&#176;C and the pulse to 179 beats per minute, with poor capillary refill. He was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Vancomycin and additional crystalloid were administered intravenously. During the first day, increasing abdominal distention, poor perfusion (as evidenced by cool extremities), and respiratory failure developed. A nasogastric tube was placed.</p>

<p>A continuous infusion of dopamine followed by norepinephrine was administered, and the trachea was intubated. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a patent foramen ovale, a small patent ductus arteriosus with left-to-right shunting, and normal ventricular function. Stools became positive for occult blood, and perianal excoriation developed. Serum levels of lactate, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. A repeat abdominal radiograph showed multiple distended loops of small bowel containing residual contrast material and relative decompression of the large bowel. Surgical consultants inserted a femoral central venous catheter and a radial arterial catheter. The administration of ampicillin was stopped, and meropenem was begun; pressors were adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure between 50 and 60 mm Hg.</p>

<p>Urine obtained by catheter on admission was cultured and grew few nonhemolytic streptococci (1000 to 10,000 colonies per milliliter; the streptococci were consistent with viridans group streptococci and were thought to be a contaminant); a blood culture was sterile. Screening of nasal specimens for respiratory viruses and enterovirus and of stool cultures for enteric pathogens and enterovirus was negative. On the third day, serum levels of lactate, magnesium, and ionic calcium were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Bicarbonate and immune globulin were administered intravenously. Total parenteral nutrition was begun.</p>

<p>During the first week, blood-pressure instability persisted and anasarca developed, with decreased urine output; dopamine, norepinephrine, albumin, and isotonic fluid boluses were administered. Vecuronium, fentanyl, and midazolam were given for sedation and analgesia. The platelet and red-cell counts decreased, and coagulation-test results showed a prolonged time to coagulation. Transfusions of platelets and red cells were administered, as was vitamin K. The serum level of C-reactive protein was 17.1 mg per liter (reference range for inflammation, &#60; 8.0); the level of alpha1-antitrypsin in the serum was 137 mg per deciliter (reference range not defined) and in stool, 328 mg per deciliter (reference range, &#60; 55). Testing of stool for Clostridium difficile toxin, cultures of stool specimens for fungi and enteric pathogens, and culture of the urine for cytomegalovirus were negative. On the fifth day, the abdomen became mottled and tense, and the abdominal girth increased from 41 to 48 cm. An abdominal ultrasound examination revealed abundant ascites with septations that were worrisome for peritonitis. Paracentesis was performed, and peritoneal fluid (30 ml) was drained; results of fluid analysis are shown in Table 2. Intravenous fluid requirements gradually decreased, and the mean arterial pressure and results of renal- and hepatic-function tests improved. Acyclovir and vancomycin were stopped, and furosemide was administered for gradual diuresis.</p>

<p>During the second week, the patient's vital signs and clinical condition gradually stabilized. Gentamicin and dopamine were stopped, norepinephrine was weaned, and gradual diuresis continued. On the 14th day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.</p>
