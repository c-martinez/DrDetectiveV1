<div id="diagnosis">2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus infection</div>

<p>A 29-year-old man was admitted in July 2009 to the critical care unit of this hospital because of fever and respiratory failure.</p>

<p>The patient had been well until 9 days earlier, when a nonproductive cough and myalgias in his legs developed. One week before admission, he had a temperature of 39.4&#176;C, associated with headache. During the next week, sore throat and nasal congestion developed, the cough became productive of clear sputum, and he noted mild chest pain under his ribs during inspiration. Four days before admission, he was seen at the emergency department of another hospital. He did not have neck pain or photophobia. He reported finding a tick on his scalp 1 month earlier. On examination, he appeared in mild distress. The temperature was 38.2&#176;C and the pulse 106 beats per minute; the remainder of the examination was normal. A rapid test of a specimen from a buccal swab was negative for influenza A and B antigens, and no parasites were seen on a peripheral-blood smear; other test results are shown in Table 1. Acetaminophen, ketorolac, and ceftriaxone were administered, and normal saline was infused. Doxycycline was prescribed, and he was discharged.</p>

<p>The patient returned the next afternoon because of persistent fever, cough, myalgias, low back pain, and new scrotal pain. The temperature was 39.0&#176;C, and the other vital signs were normal. There were rhonchi in the left lower lung field, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A test for Lyme disease, sent the day before, was negative. Other test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed incomplete segmental consolidation of the apical posterior segment of the right upper lobe and right hilar prominence, features suggestive of pneumonia and lymphadenopathy, respectively. Levofloxacin was prescribed, and he was sent home.</p>

<p>During the next 2 days, nausea and vomiting developed, with blood-tinged emesis. One day before admission to this hospital, the patient returned to the other hospital. The temperature was 38.6&#176;C, the blood pressure 135/70 mm Hg, the pulse 113 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while he was breathing 4 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. A chest radiograph revealed progression of the process in the right upper lobe and patchy air-space disease in the right lower lobe and the middle and lower lobes on the left side. Nucleic acid testing for Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum and testing for serum antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, sent 3 days earlier, were negative. A rapid screening test for pharyngitis due to group A streptococcus and review of a blood smear for parasites were negative; other results are shown in Table 1. He was admitted to the hospital. Doxycycline, levofloxacin, gentamicin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, ondansetron, guaifenesin-codeine cough syrup, and ranitidine were administered. Respiratory distress worsened. Testing for antibodies to Francisella tularensis was negative. Approximately 14 hours after admission, he was transferred to this hospital by helicopter and admitted to the critical care unit.</p>

<p>The patient reported transient arthralgias in his ankles and knees, which had resolved; he had not had rash, lymphadenopathy, visual symptoms, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, or bruising. He had been well before the illness. He lived with his wife in a rural area in southern New England that has a high rate of tickborne illness. Two weeks earlier, he had been exposed to a child with an upper respiratory infection who had been visiting from the southeastern United States; there were no other exposures to ill persons and no recent travel. He worked indoors and outdoors, and except for the tick, he had no recent history of insect bites or exposure to animals. He had swum in the ocean but not in fresh water, and he had cleaned fish 2 weeks earlier. He did not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs. On examination, he appeared ill and dyspneic. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.6. The temperature was 37.3&#176;C, the blood pressure 119/68 mm Hg, the mean arterial pressure 93 mm Hg, the pulse 108 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 29 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92 to 95% while he was breathing 50% inspired oxygen. There were rhonchi in both lung bases and occasional wheezes; the remainder of the examination was normal. Tests for tularemia agglutination, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus, heterophile antibodies, and antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus and B. burgdorferi were negative, as was nucleic acid testing for anaplasma and ehrlichia. Multiple tests of nasopharyngeal secretions for influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus and tests of the urine for legionella and histoplasma antigens were negative. Testing for antibodies to toxoplasma was suggestive of past infection. No malarial or babesial forms were seen on peripheral-blood smears. Cultures of specimens of blood, urine, and sputum were sterile. Other results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine with a pH of 5.5, a specific gravity of 1.005, 1+ ketones, 2+ blood, 1+ albumin, and 0 to 2 red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes, with air-space disease in the right upper and middle lung and the left lower lung and elevation of the right minor fissure, features consistent with multifocal pneumonia. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and was otherwise normal. Oral levofloxacin; intravenous vancomycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline; and oral oseltamivir (150 mg twice daily) were administered.</p>

<p>During the first 6 hours, dyspnea and respiratory distress worsened; the respiratory rate was 24 to 26 breaths per minute, with 85 to 90% oxygen saturation while he was breathing 100% oxygen through a face mask that prevents rebreathing. Nine hours after arrival, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, without the administration of contrast material, showed extensive bilateral multifocal asymmetric consolidation involving all lobes, trace pleural effusion on the right, and multiple enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes (up to 1.3 cm in diameter). Within 18 hours after arrival, tachypnea increased further; the partial pressure of oxygen was 58 mm Hg while he was breathing high-flow oxygen, and the trachea was intubated. The partial pressure of oxygen rose to 83 mm Hg while the patient was being ventilated with 100% oxygen. A central venous catheter was placed, a feeding tube inserted, and parenteral nutrition begun. The maximum temperature was 39.4&#176;C.</p>

<p>On the second day, hypoxemia (Table 2) and renal failure (Table 1) developed and urine output fell to 20 to 30 ml per hour. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 50% and was otherwise normal. Microscopical examination of the urine sediment revealed white-cell casts and granular casts, with tubular cells and nondysmorphic red cells. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was begun, complicated by catheter-related thrombosis. Heparin was administered.</p>

<p>On the third day, a test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a dilution of 1:40, in a speckled pattern, and negative at dilutions of 1:80 and 1:160 (reference range, negative at 1:40 and 1:160); a test for antibodies to double-stranded DNA was negative; and levels of lactic acid, complement (C3 and C4), and methemoglobin were normal. Other laboratory data are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Hypotension developed, with a mean systemic arterial pressure between 40 mm Hg and 50 mm Hg; pressors were administered, methylprednisolone was added, and heparin was discontinued. On the evening of the third day, the right pupil became eccentric, irregular, and dilated to 8 mm in diameter, without reactivity to light; the left pupil was round, 5 mm in diameter, and reactive to light to 3 mm, and there was no papilledema on funduscopic examination. The patient was considered too unstable for imaging studies of the brain to be obtained. Hypertonic saline, mannitol, and ceftriaxone were administered. On the sixth day, a diagnostic-test result was received.</p>
